        Hello, my name is Mika. <br>
        I'm just your average type girl from a small, but maybe influential country. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        This <!-- Place arrow with a good sized picture (either sized with css or beforehand with photoshop)<a href="http://www.cbs.com/shows/ncis_los_angeles/cast/72038/"> or <img src="" alt="" /></a>-->
      </p>
      <p>
        is sorta what I look like, but it isn't a picture of me. <br>
        It's a picture of Nell Jones from <a href="http://www.cbs.com/shows/ncis_los_angeles/cast/72038/">NCIS LA.</a>

        I guess if you would really want to know what I look like in real life,
        you could probably google my name <em>Mika</em> and find some pictures of the real me
        (or maybe not :p).
